# A quick guide to *Markdown*

Markdown is an **easy-to-read and easy-to-write text format**, enabling **humans and robots to understand the structure** of a document.

The idea is that text documents should be publishable without being obfuscated by complex formatting instructions and without specific tools to view them.

The following guide will teach you the basics of *Markdown*. The [Markdown Syntax Documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) covers all features.


## 1. Headings

To create a heading, simply put a hash/pound sign (`#`) in front of a line:

```markdown
# This is a first level heading.
```

*Markdown* supports up to six levels of heading, simply by adding more `#` signs:

```markdown
# Level 1 heading.
## Level 2 heading.
### Level 3 heading.
#### Level 4 heading.
##### Level 5 heading.
###### Level 6 heading.
```


## 2. Paragraphs

Paragraphs are separated by line breaks:

```markdown
# This is the heading

Here is an introductory paragraph.

Here is another paragraph. Thus concludes this English lecture.
```


## 3. Emphasis

Parts may be marked as *emphasised* or **important**, like so:

```markdown
Parts may be marked as *emphasised* or **important**.
```


## 4. Lists

*Unordered* lists can be created by using `-` or `*`:

```markdown
- go shopping
- clean the dishes
- do the laundry
- repair the bycicle

* change tires
* check the motor
```

*Ordered* lists can be created by using numbers:

```markdown
1. do work
2. have lunch
3. do work
4. leave the office
```

*Nested* lists can be written by **indenting with 4 spaces**. *Ordered* and *unordered* lists can be mixed at any time.

```markdown
1. go shopping
    - potatoes
    - onions
2. cook a meal
	1. chop the vegetables
	2. fry them
3. enjoy!
```


## 5. Links

Hyperlinks are pretty important, too.

```markdown
