# A quick guide to *Markdown*

Markdown is an **easy-to-read and easy-to-write text format**, enabling **humans and robots to understand the structure** of a document.

The idea is that Markdown-formatted **documents should be publishable in their original form**, without being obfuscated by complex formatting instructions and without specific tools to view them.

The following guide will teach you the basics of *Markdown*. The [Markdown Syntax Documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) covers all features.


## 1. Headings

To create a heading, simply put a hash/pound sign (`#`) in front of a line:

```markdown
# This is a first level heading.
```

*Markdown* supports up to six levels of heading, simply by adding more `#` signs:

```markdown
# Level 1 heading.
## Level 2 heading.
### Level 3 heading.
#### Level 4 heading.
##### Level 5 heading.
###### Level 6 heading.
```


## 2. Paragraphs

Paragraphs are separated by line breaks:

```markdown
# This is the heading

Here is an introductory paragraph.

Here is another paragraph. Thus concludes this English lecture.

## 3. Emphasis

Parts may be marked as *emphasied* or **important**, like so:

```markdown
